__This repo is a comprehensive collection of awesome research (papers, codes, etc.) and other items about video domain adaptation.__ 

Domain adaptation has been a focus of research in transfer learning, enabling models to improve robustness which is crucial to apply models to real-world applications. Despite a long history of domain adaptation research, there has been limited discussions on __video domain adaptation__. This repo aims to present a collection of research on video domain adaptation including papers, code, etc. 

_Feel free to star, fork or raise an issue to include your research or to add in more categories! Discussion is most welcomed!_

# Explanatory Notes
This repository categorizes video domain adaptation papers according to the domain adaptation scenarios (i.e., closed-set, partial-set, source-free etc.). These include both semi-supervised, weakly-supervised and unsupervised DA. By default, VDA research focus on action recognition. For other tasks, related papers will be categorized into the relevant sub-categories.

<sup><sub>This repository is inspired by the [ADA](https://github.com/zhaoxin94/awesome-domain-adaptation) repository, a repository with awesome domain adaptation papers. For more research on domain adaptation (with images/point cloud etc.) you may check out that repository.</sub></sup>
